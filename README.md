# Weather Mobile Application

Introducing a user-friendly weather app designed to provide real-time weather updates based on your current location. Developed using Swift on Xcode, this app simplifies the process by asking for your location upfront to deliver accurate weather forecasts. Once you grant permission to access your location, the app displays essential weather information such as humidity, minimum and maximum temperatures(in Celsius), and wind speed.
